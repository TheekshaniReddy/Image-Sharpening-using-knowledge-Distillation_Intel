# Triplet Dataset Preparation for Knowledge Distillation

This script generates a **robust triplet dataset** for image enhancement via knowledge distillation.

## üë®‚Äçüè´ Triplet Structure
- **HR (Ground Truth)**
- **Teacher Input** (Upscaled blurry/noisy image)
- **Student Input** (Heavily degraded image)

## üîß Configuration
Edit the following in `Data_Preparation.py`:
```python
SOURCE_DIR = "path_to_raw_hr_images"
TARGET_DIR = "path_to_save_triplets"

## üìù Project Objective

The goal of this project was to develop an efficient deep learning model capable of restoring clarity and sharpness to low-quality video frames caused by low bandwidth or poor network conditions. The final model was required to be fast enough for real-time applications (30-60 FPS) while maintaining high visual quality.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Knowledge Distillation:** A large "Teacher" U-Net model was used to train a small, lightweight "Student" RRDBNet model.
- **Robust Custom Dataset:** A specialized dataset was created to simulate real-world video artifacts, including compression, noise, and mixed-resolution blur.
- **High-Performance Inference:** The final model is benchmarked on both GPU (with PyTorch) and CPU (with OpenVINO) to demonstrate its efficiency.
- **Real-Time Capable:** The optimized model achieves real-time performance on standard CPU hardware, making it suitable for broad deployment.

## üèõÔ∏è Model Architectures

- **Teacher (U-Net):** A wide U-Net architecture was chosen for its strength in understanding image context and producing a high-quality, structurally accurate target for the student to learn from.
- **Student (RRDBNet):** A lightweight RRDBNet was chosen for its exceptional ability to generate realistic, high-frequency textures and its computationally efficient design, which performs heavy processing at low resolution.

## üìä Final Performance Results

The final Student model was benchmarked on a diverse validation set, yielding the following results:

| Hardware | Framework | Pure Model FPS | Quality (SSIM) |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **NVIDIA T4 GPU** | PyTorch | ~58.5 FPS | 0.878 |
| **Intel CPU** | PyTorch (Baseline) | ~4.2 FPS | 0.894 |
| **Intel CPU** | **OpenVINO‚Ñ¢ (Optimized)** |   | 0.894 |

Conclusion: The OpenVINO‚Ñ¢ optimization provided a **~20x performance increase** on the CPU, successfully elevating the model to real-time capability on standard hardware.
